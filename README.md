# Zenith

Zenith is a tcp/ip client server with authentication.
this project is an experimentation for my future SDK's that require fast communication
without the use of HTTP.

will refine the project later so it could be used publicly as a base for connectors etc..

## Installation

No external dependencies are required.

## Usage

### Running the server

```bash
python3 server.py
```

### Running the client

```bash
python3 client.py
```
